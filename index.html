                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>What is Orca?</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Orca is a decentralized exchange designed for the Solana blockchain that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies and tokens quickly and efficiently. Launched in 2021, Orca aims to provide a seamless trading experience while emphasizing user engagement and community involvement.<br><br><strong>Key Features of Orca:</strong><br><strong>Automated Market Maker (AMM):</strong> Orca employs an AMM model, allowing users to trade assets without the need for an order book.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>How Orca Works:</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Orca operates on the principles of automated market making, which differs from traditional exchanges' order book models. Here’s a closer look at how it functions:<br><br><strong>Automated Market Maker Model</strong><br>In an AMM model, users trade against liquidity pools rather than individual buyers and sellers. These pools consist of pairs of tokens that users contribute to in exchange for LP tokens, representing their share of the pool. The AMM algorithm determines the price of tokens based on their supply and demand within the pool, ensuring efficient price discovery.<br><br><strong>Liquidity Pools</strong><br>Liquidity pools are essential to Orca's functionality. Users can deposit pairs of tokens, creating a pool that traders can access. When users provide liquidity, they earn a portion of the transaction fees generated by trades within that pool. This model encourages users to contribute to liquidity, ensuring that traders can execute their transactions without delays.<br><br><strong>Yield Farming</strong><br>Orca allows users to engage in yield farming by staking their LP tokens. By locking their tokens in a yield farm, users can earn additional rewards in the form of ORCA tokens. This incentivizes liquidity provision and helps maintain a healthy ecosystem.</p>
